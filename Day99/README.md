 program should:

1.Scrape the Replit Community Hub for events and put them into a list.
2.Filter the events by topics that interest you (remember how we filtered news articles from hacker news?)
3.Schedule the scrape for every 6 hours.
4.If an event of interest is scraped, email yourself (or a friend) with a hyperlink to the event.
5.Only email any new events.
